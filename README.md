# OpenS3D - MATLAB

Computer Vision Drafts/Proofs of Concept for OpenS3D techniques.

Techniques implementation is in `camera_alignment/alignment`.

Kalman filter tests are in `camera_alignment/tests/virtual/test_kalman.m` and were used to generate comparative test data in `camera_alignment/results`.
